PRCP-1027: Skin Disorder Prediction Project Overview

Problem Statement
Task 1: Prepare a comprehensive data analysis report.
Task 2: Build a predictive machine learning model to classify skin disorders.
Task 3: Provide suggestions for doctors to identify skin diseases early.

Dataset Summary
Attributes: 34 (12 clinical + 22 histopathological + 1 nominal class + age)
Target Diseases: Psoriasis, Seborrheic Dermatitis, Lichen Planus, Pityriasis Rosea, Chronic Dermatitis, Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris.

Data Features:
Clinical: Erythema, scaling, itching, etc.
Histopathological: Melanin incontinence, PNL infiltrate, acanthosis, etc.
Value Range: 0â€“3 (presence/intensity), family history (0 or 1), age (linear).
Deliverables
Data Analysis Report:

Explore, clean, and visualize data to identify patterns and correlations.
Analyze disease prevalence and feature importance.
Model Comparison Report:

Train multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).
Evaluate with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Recommend the best model for production.
Challenges Report:

Highlight data challenges (missing values, class imbalance, feature scaling, etc.).
Document preprocessing techniques and rationale.
Suggestions for Doctors:

Present insights and predictions to aid early diagnosis.
Output
Single Jupyter Notebook: Includes data analysis, model building, evaluation, challenges, and final recommendations.
